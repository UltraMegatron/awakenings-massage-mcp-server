   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   cd landing-page
   vercel
   ```

3. Your HTTPS URL will be: `https://awakenings-canva-sync.vercel.app`

### Canva App Settings:
```
Redirect URI: https://awakenings-canva-sync.vercel.app/canva-callback
```

## Option 2: Netlify

2. Drag and drop your `landing-page` folder
3. Get instant HTTPS URL

### Manual Deploy:

2. Drop on Netlify dashboard
3. Get URL like: `https://magical-name-123456.netlify.app`

## Option 3: Railway

### Steps:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)

## Environment Variables for Production

Set these in your hosting platform:

```env
CANVA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_canva
CANVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_from_canva
BASE_URL=https://your-deployed-domain.com
PORT=3000
```

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Visit your HTTPS URL
2. Click "Connect to Canva"
3. Should redirect to Canva OAuth
4. After authorization, should redirect back with success

## Canva Developer App Configuration

Use your new HTTPS URL:

```
App Name: Awakenings Massage Company Social Media
Description: Professional social media content creation for massage therapy
Redirect URI: https://your-domain.com/canva-callback
Scopes: design:content:read design:content:write folder:read folder:write
```

## üéØ Quick Start with Vercel

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Navigate to landing page
cd social-media-mcp-server/landing-page

# 3. Deploy (first time)
vercel

# 4. Deploy updates
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (needs 16+)
2. **Environment variables**: Set in hosting platform dashboard
3. **OAuth fails**: Verify redirect URI matches exactly
4. **CORS errors**: Ensure HTTPS is used throughout

### Verification Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Site loads over HTTPS
2. ‚úÖ Callback URL is accessible
3. ‚úÖ Environment variables are set
4. ‚úÖ Canva app configuration matches

Your professional HTTPS website will be ready for Canva OAuth integration!
